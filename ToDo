To Do:

    1.8 Stuff:

        BUG: when shift keybinding to open alt gui of equipped pack, same null error as non-initialized shift right click gui
            Null itemstack on client side - why? check difference between open normal and open alt
            Probably the server isn't updated, it has the client ~ Could be something with UUIDs
            once fixed add this ability to changelog

        add registry items to API
            check BM api
            check inv tweaks api

        Fix tooltips so they render on top of everything

        add crafttweaker support
        JEI handlers for crafting

        fix config nonsense

        config option for entity rendering in fpp on client or not

        then API/cut ids/refactor, etc.

        bm blacklist for config to disable items (requested config option)

        add commands to remove stored packs' IEEP data


    NOW:

	Change to fuzzy filter on void

	limit ids so it can go in unabridged

	blocks are all in the itemRegistry
	So new ItemStack(Items.itemRegistry.getObject(new ResourceLocation(BloodMagic:BlockRitualStone))) would work
		
    SOON:

        GIT STUFF:

        REFACTOR:

            Data storage in player pack?
                check register packets also had to server side - ex: error on server startup if no getClientPlayer() - that's a bug

        TESTING:


        BUGS:


        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:

            texture update (message CyanideX/interview person)

            Check the sv + es translation files

            When I have time to play, tweaks for default config values

            Real API/Interfaces
                (IEventUpgrade?)
                Actually check for (if instance of IUpgradableBackpack) etc.

            Tick Handler
                Restocking upgrade onItemPlaced - ask in IRC if the onBlockPlacedEvent exists
                Crafting upgrade onItemPutInBackpack (so for manually putting items in)

            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?

            Have quick deposit upgrade work with equipped backpack
                use a keybinding?

            Have depth upgrade apply to the IBlockProvider --> wait for Vazkii API update

            Add ender upgrade(s)?
                depthEnder - allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
                vanillaEnder - vanilla ender chest linked backpack (with backpack able to take upgrades)
                remoteEnder - or specified filter linking to a specific chest

            Allow shift right click equipped?

            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                    look into if this is possible

            Make textures of upgrades more 3D looking

            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

            Add documentation book - see TiCon books source
                * or add ExtraUtils style docs with "u" in NEI * <-- This one, check power converters Github for implementation
                Botania has this now?

            Add Baubles integration as belt slot to equip
                config option to toggle between?
                Traveler's gear compat too

            crafting upgrade check if backpack is full (#31)
                should do a different long-term solution because you can maybe make less slots even if the backpack is full with crafting
                so a simple check for 'do all the slots have items' isn't sufficient. I should check if it has anything but a tiny crafting
                upgrade since the other two can condense item slots (assuming there is space for them to put the new items).

        EXTRA:
            add -b to beta versions in build.gradle
            add api into versioning (https://mcforge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/conventions/versioning/)

            Fancier config updating/replacing values
                See botania, vazkii is going to implement something similar
                    check current version somehow and compare to origin/versions.txt, if less then do something

            fancy crafting upgrade - choose 1 or 2 or 3 diameter w/ button underneath (like adv. filter)

            mining filter - change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?

            change it so an entityItem looks to fill a stack in the player's inv before going in filter?

            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably

            Shift right click to open nested guis too

            Change sorting to a configurable style (i.e. id, name, etc.) w/ right click sort button to change style in game

            add in config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
                no shapeless crafting for removal of upgrades, have to use the crafted one specifically

            Add achievements

            Recipes via config - support meta/damage values


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method
            (IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)
            4 tiers (or upgrade and drops excess items onto ground), or adds barrel slot like a DSU?

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it
