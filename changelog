Version 1.7.10 - 1.2.9
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- None

Changes

    - You have the option to turn this off with, surprise surprise, a new config value.

Bug Fixes
- None
------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7.10 - 1.2.8
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- The backpack is now an IBlockProvider (from Botania's API) meaning it can supply items to The Rod of the Shifting Mantle
    Note that this only works if the backpack is in the inventory, it doesn't work if it is equipped.
    This is not on my end, but I have contacted Vazkii and a fix should hopefully occur though.

Changes
- Localized a lot more of the code.
- The backpacks only save their inventory when the inventory actually updates.
- Reverted back to the old versioning system of Major-Minor-BuildNumber

Bug Fixes
- Closes #30 (Equipped backpack works correctly with dimension changes)
- Closes #31 (Crafting upgrade shouldn't cause as much lag)
- Closes #34 (Sneak right clicking with a certain set of upgrades doesn't crash it)
------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7.10 - 27
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- None

Changes
- None

Bug Fixes
- Crafting upgrade using the wrong recipe (3x1 row instead of a 3x3 grid)
------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7.10 - 26
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- Small Crafting Upgrade: Crafts in a 2x2 grid (ex: sand -> sandstone)
- Small Crafting Upgrade: Crafts in a 1x1 grid (so a single item, ex: wood -> planks)

Changes
- Description of of mining filter to show that it picks up gems and dusts as well.
- Changed versioning to r(MC_Version)-(Mod_Version) (ex: r1.7.10-26) because I am doing a lot of builds
- gradle.build is fancier now (by default it will clean, update version number, build, upload to curse, and make a new changelog segment for the next version)

Bug Fixes
- Precautionary fix for sided inventories and inserting items via the quick deposit upgrade (may fix the unduplicated StorageDrawers bug)
