------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.9 - 2.0.0.0 (versioning: major-api-minor-build)
------------------------------------------------------
Initial Port to Minecraft 1.8.9 as a rewrite

Additions (in relation to 1.7.10 - 1.2.15)
- You can crouch while opening an equipped backpack to open up the equipped backpack's alternate gui directly.

Changes (in relation to 1.7.10 - 1.2.15)
- The entire mod now only takes 6 Item IDs!
    - 4 for the backpacks (each one is still a separate item), 1 for all the upgrades, and 1 for all the crafting items.
- Default keybinding to open backpack is 'c' and to equip is now 'v'.
- The backpack no longer renders on the client if the player is in first person perspective (configurable).
- The void filter deletes items by fuzzy detection now (instead of exact as it was before)
- Removed the option to have an alternate backpack texture.
- Removed the ability to remove an upgrade by crafting a backpack with the upgrade twice (the normal removal method still works though).
- Removed compatibility with OpenBlocks and EnderStorage, since neither of those mods have updated.
- Start of a full fledged API.
- (Internal) Tons of various minor fixes/changes/optimizations.
- (Internal) Changed how backpacks are stored internally, both for death and in general (uses two IEEPs), should be more stable.

Bug Fixes (in relation to 1.7.10 - 1.2.15)
- Tooltips now render on top of everything (it won't be hidden by JEI's items).
