Version 1.8.9 - 2.0.3
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- None

Changes
- The restocking upgrade no longer sorts the backpack when restocking.
    - Temporary "bug" introduced, where if you pick up items on the ground that are larger than the stack to resupply and you have a filter they will go in the filter and not resupply.
    - You don't lose any items, and it is a specific uncommon-ish case, but the player has to pick something up to actually resupply in that case, which isn't ideal. Will be fixed in next version.

Bug Fixes
- The Nesting Upgrade should actually work properly now.

------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8.9 - 2.0.0 (versioning: major-minor-build)
------------------------------------------------------
Initial Port to Minecraft 1.8.9 as a rewrite (and I rewrote *a lot*)

Additions (in relation to 1.7.10 - 1.2.15)
- When upgrading a backpack past basic you must now choose which emphasis you want on the upgraded backpack.
    - Storage Emphasis backpacks have more raw storage capacity at the cost of less upgrade points (all configurable amounts).
    - Upgrade Emphasis backpacks have more upgrade points at the cost of less raw storage capacity (all configurable amounts).
- The upgrades now have a certain (configurable) minimum tier of backpack they can be applied to.
- When removing an upgrade you now get said upgrade returned back in the crafting grid, much like how you get empty buckets back when crafting a cake.
- The void filter is now an additional selectable filter type in the advanced filter.
- You can crouch while opening an equipped backpack to open up the equipped backpack's alternate gui directly.
- The number of additional upgrade points is now configurable for each backpack (except basic, as it can't accept any).
- Config option to make the backpack no longer renders on the client if the player is in first person perspective.

Changes (in relation to 1.7.10 - 1.2.15)
- Made the mod significantly easier to get into in regards to recipes/resource costs.
- The entire mod now takes substantially less Item IDs!
    - 4 for the backpacks (each one is still a separate item), 1 for all the upgrades, and 1 for all the crafting items.
- Default keybinding to open backpack is 'c' and to equip is now 'v'.
- The void filter deletes items by fuzzy detection now (instead of exact as it was before)
- Removed the ability to configure item recipes directly from this mod's config (MineTweaker/CraftTweaker should work just fine though)
- Removed the option to have an alternate backpack texture.
- Removed the ability to remove an upgrade by crafting a backpack with the upgrade twice (the normal removal method still works though).
- Removed compatibility with OpenBlocks and EnderStorage, since neither of those mods have updated.
- Start of a full fledged API.
- (Internal) Tons of various minor fixes/changes/optimizations.
- (Internal) Changed how backpacks are stored internally, both for death and in general (uses two IEEPs), should be more stable.
- (Internal) Changed how the additional upgrade points are stored.

Bug Fixes (in relation to 1.7.10 - 1.2.15)
- Tooltips now render on top of everything (it won't be hidden by JEI's items).
- Many minor fixes (some preemptive)
