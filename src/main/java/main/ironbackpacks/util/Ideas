To Do:

    NOW:

        Gradle:
            changelog number was 1 behind? Check that it wasn't a fluke next time

    SOON:

        gui/container/inv deep refactor via 1.8

        GIT STUFF:
            merge devSweden 1.2.0 to master
            delete devSweden and update dev when I go back home

        REFACTOR:
            Data storage in player pack?

        TESTING:


        BUGS:


        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:

            Restocking not working with arrows?
                of course, not picking anything up - something should change? design decisions...
                Need to implement a custom tick handler and/or ask in IRC if the onBlockPlacedEvent exists

            config recipe for basic backpack
            make crafting upgrade work when manually putting items in
            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?
            Have depth upgrade apply to quick deposit
            Add ender upgrade?
                allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
            Allow shift right click equipped?
            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                    look into if this is possible
                add IBlockProvider for use with botania's rods
            Make textures of upgrades more 3D looking
            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

            New removal system of upgrades?
                Craft backpack with nothing else, slot if crafting grid determines which upgrade to remove
                    i.e. 1st slot means 1st upgrade removed, 2nd slot -> 2nd upgrade removed,..., 9th slot -> 9th upgrade removed
                        if more than 9 upgrades you have to keep on doing it, but that is an acceptable cost
                if can't do this, do eraser item

            Add documentation book - see TiCon books source
                * or add ExtraUtils style docs with "u" in NEI * <-- This one, check power converters Github for implementation

        EXTRA:

            fancy crafting upgrade - choose 1 or 2 or 3 diameter w/ button underneath (like adv. filter)
            mining filter - change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?
            change it so an entityItem looks to fill a stack in the player's inv before going in filter?
            keybinding to make quickdeposit work with equipped pack
            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably
            Shift right click to open nested guis too
            Change sorting to a configurable style (i.e. id, name, etc.) w/ right click sort button to change style in game
            add in config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
            Add achievements
            Recipes via config - support meta/damage values


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method
            (IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)
            4 tiers (or upgrade and drops excess items onto ground), or adds barrel slot like a DSU?

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it

Know Bugs:
    IMPORTANT:

    Less important:
        Scrolling too fast in the advanced filter dupes items (but they are ghost items so no big deal)
        Mod armors that have larger custom models might overlap with my backpack model, just visually annoying
