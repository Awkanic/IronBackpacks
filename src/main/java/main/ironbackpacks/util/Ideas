To Do:

    NOW:

        Gradle:
            changelog number was 1 behind? Check that it wasn't a fluke next time

    SOON:

        gui/container/inv deep refactor via 1.8

        GIT STUFF:
            master -> delete
                rename local devSweden to master
                    push local branch so master == head on origin
                make a new dev branch
                    delete old one
                        push to github

        REFACTOR:
            Data storage in player pack?

        TESTING:

            real environment with and without Botania to make sure the @Optional is working
            test onItemPickup and save() working the correct amount (not too much[lag], not too little[needs to save still])

            dimension changed saving right backpack and no forge error
                log-in and span event with the currEquippedPack okay as well

            test fix for crafting upgrade

        BUGS:

            crafting upgrade check if backpack is full (#31)
                should do a different long-term solution because you can maybe make less slots even if the backpack is full with crafting
                so a simple check for 'do all the slots have items' isn't sufficient. I should check if it has anything but a tiny crafting
                upgrade since the other two can condense item slots (assuming there is space for them to put the new items).

        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:

            work with onItemPickup only calling save() when it needs to
                see if this affects crafting upgrade lag (#31)

            Tick Handler
                Restocking upgrade onItemPlaced - ask in IRC if the onBlockPlacedEvent exists
                Crafting upgrade onItemPutInBackpack (so for manually putting items in)

            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?
            Have depth upgrade apply to quick deposit
                and to the IBlockProvider
            Add ender upgrade?
                allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
            Allow shift right click equipped?
            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                    look into if this is possible

            Make textures of upgrades more 3D looking
            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

            New removal system of upgrades?
                Craft backpack with nothing else, slot if crafting grid determines which upgrade to remove
                    i.e. 1st slot means 1st upgrade removed, 2nd slot -> 2nd upgrade removed,..., 9th slot -> 9th upgrade removed
                        if more than 9 upgrades you have to keep on doing it, but that is an acceptable cost
                if can't do this, do eraser item

            Add documentation book - see TiCon books source
                * or add ExtraUtils style docs with "u" in NEI * <-- This one, check power converters Github for implementation

            Config updating/replacing values
                See botania, vazkii is going to implement something similar

            Add Baubles integration as belt slot to equip
                config option to toggle between?

        EXTRA:

            fancy crafting upgrade - choose 1 or 2 or 3 diameter w/ button underneath (like adv. filter)
            mining filter - change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?
            change it so an entityItem looks to fill a stack in the player's inv before going in filter?
            keybinding to make quickdeposit work with equipped pack
            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably
            Shift right click to open nested guis too
            Change sorting to a configurable style (i.e. id, name, etc.) w/ right click sort button to change style in game
            add in config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
            Add achievements
            Recipes via config - support meta/damage values


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method
            (IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)
            4 tiers (or upgrade and drops excess items onto ground), or adds barrel slot like a DSU?

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it

Know Bugs:
    IMPORTANT:

    Less important:
        Scrolling too fast in the advanced filter dupes items (but they are ghost items so no big deal)
        Mod armors that have larger custom models might overlap with my backpack model, just visually annoying
