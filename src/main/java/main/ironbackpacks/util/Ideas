To Do:

    Figure out filter expansion (18 slots) upgrade

        make it actually filter the items in event handler

        scroll mouse wheel in slots to move (addition to the buttons)?
        move (all alt gui) up a pixel alt. gui. so that it looks nicer w/ adv. filter

        BUGS:
            move tooltips to foreground
            broke clear buttons
            flicker on buttons for inv tweaks when initGui() (remove buttons for alt. gui. to fix)

            refactor 2 numbers from one number

    Adv. nesting upgrade (allows any backpack)

    Add in option where right clicking a backpack item in an inventory opens gui of said backpack

    Update config

    Test quick deposit upgrade more (just to make sure)
