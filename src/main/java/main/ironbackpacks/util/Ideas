To Do:

    NOW:


    SOON:

        TODO: cleanCache for new forge to actually update
        gui/container/inv deep refactor via 1.8

        GIT STUFF:
            merge devSweden 1.2.0 to master
            delete devSweden and update dev when I go back home

        REFACTOR:
            Data storage in player pack?

        TESTING:

            check if it works in a modpack with open blocks (and try the render specifically)

        BUGS:



        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:

            Restocking not working with arrows?
                of course, not picking anything up - something should change? design decisions...

            config recipe for basic backpack
            make crafting upgrade work when manually putting items in
            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?
            Crafting upgrade in 2x2
            Have depth upgrade apply to quick deposit
            Add items "gem" and "dust" to miner filter -add to tooltip and changelog
                change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?
            Add ender upgrade?
                allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory
            Allow shift right click equipped?
            Add in more inter-mod compatibility
                right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
                add IBlockProvider for use with botania's rods
            Make textures of upgrades more 3D looking
            Make it so you can't move the opened backpack with number key presses, as there might be some dupe bug using that that I missed

        EXTRA:

            keybinding to make quickdeposit work with equipped pack
            quick deposit into AE terminals - have to check efficient of deposit code for that to work probably
            Shift right click to open nested guis too
            Change sorting to a configurable style (i.e. id, name, etc.) w/ right click sort button to change style in game
            add in config option (and subsequent functionality) where the itemBackpack can't be opened directly, it has to be equipped to be open (i.e. only one open at a time)
                hard mode: weight is a factor? Harder nesting recipe for limited space? Some other way to increase space/nesting via gameplay/in-game research/other?
            New removal system of upgrades?
                Craft backpack with nothing else, slot if crafting grid determines which upgrade to remove
                    i.e. 1st slot means 1st upgrade removed, 2nd slot -> 2nd upgrade removed,..., 9th slot -> 9th upgrade removed
                        if more than 9 upgrades you have to keep on doing it, but that is an acceptable cost
                if can't do this, do eraser item
            Add documentation book - see TiCon books source
                * or add ExtraUtils style docs with "u" in NEI * <-- This one, check power converters Github for implementation
            Add achievements


    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it

Changelog:

ADDED: Precise Quick Deposit Upgrade
FIXED: Bug with quick deposit adding a ghost item

MCF Posting:
info for precise quick deposit

More pictures
Mod armors that have larger custom models might overlap with my backpack model, just visually annoying


Balance/Play With:


Bugs:
    IMPORTANT:


    Less important:
        Scrolling too fast in the advanced filter dupes items (but they are ghost items so no big deal)
        Fix direct deposit into AE terminals
