To Do:

    SOON:


    LATER:
        Render on backpack
            equip with hotkeys

        Ender/Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)

        Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

Changelog:
ADDED: Documentation to the code. People actually do that?!?
CHANGED: Refactored the internal code so that, along with the documentation, it is now an acceptable instance of source code for others to learn from.
FIXED: Dupe bug with opening the same backpack that is already open via right click and the items not updating.
