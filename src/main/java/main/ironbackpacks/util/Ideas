    Gold[DONE]
    Diamond[DONE]

    Reed
    Leather
    Feather

Types:
    Item
    Barrel
    Fluid - acts like bucket when right click

Upgrades:
    Search upgrade - NEI search bar
    Button upgrade[DONE] - add another to move everything from inventory to backpack? Condense items button?
    Nesting upgrade[DONE] - lower tier goes in higher tier
    Renaming upgrade[WIP] - rename the backpack, included by default -change background color of text box to light brown (see anvil) + redo button to say "rename"
    Hopper upgrade - keeps an item stocked
    Condenser upgrade - compresses items
    Filter upgrade - automatically picks up specified items
    Inventory upgrade - extends inventory (probably only will be used in final tier)
    Camelpack upgrade - eat from it
    Umbrella upgrade - slow fall
    KeepOnDeath upgrade - really expensive but keep backpack on death
    RemoveUpgrades upgrade - unlikely because difficulty implementing
    UpgradeAddon upgrade - adds another upgrade slot

Textures:
    Change "name" button to "rename"

    Redo:
        Nest
        Nest upgrade
        Button Upgrade
        all the backpacks?

        Damage Bar Upgrade
        Filter Upgrade

Misc features:

    Crafting - support damage values
    Add tiers to upgrades (so you need at least tier x of backpack to apply it)

Future Refactoring:
    Change upgrades to be one item differentiated by damage value
