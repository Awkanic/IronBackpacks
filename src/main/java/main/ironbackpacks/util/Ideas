To Do:

Balance/Play With:
    Fancier config file
    Most of the default recipes

Bugs:
    IMPORTANT:

    Less important:
        Items move around in alternate gui when another alt. gui upgrade is added
        UUID not working?

Figure out:

Tiers:
    Leather[DONE]
    Iron[DONE]
    Gold[DONE]
    Diamond[DONE]

    Reed
    Leather
    Feather

Types:
    Item
    Barrel
    Fluid - acts like bucket when right click

Upgrades:
    Search upgrade - NEI search bar
    Button upgrade[DONE] - Condense items button? -If ghostSlot doesn't work, add buttons for shift-clicking-like feature for alt gui upgrades
    Nesting upgrade[DONE] - lower tier goes in higher tier
    Renaming upgrade{ALT GUI}[WIP] - rename the backpack, included by default -change background color of text box to light brown (see anvil) + redo button to say "rename"
    Hopper upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE] - keeps an item stocked - needs to have at least 1 of target item in player's inventory to resupply
    Condenser upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE] - compresses items
    Filter upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE] - automatically picks up specified items - Button to alter fuzzy behavior?
    Inventory upgrade - extends inventory (probably only will be used in final tier)
    Camelpack upgrade - eat from it
    Umbrella upgrade - slow fall
    KeepOnDeath upgrade - really expensive but keep backpack on death
    UpgradeAddon upgrade - adds another upgrade slot - would have to store UpgradeCount as NBT data

    If add another alt.Gui upgrade have to check recipe before applying (b/c can only have 3 alt. gui upgrades (plus naming) due to gui sizing limitation unless I expand the gui horizontally).

Textures:
    Change "name" button to "rename" - background as button w/ overlayed localized name?

    Redo:
        Nest
        all the backpacks?

    Do:

Misc features:
    Add in colorable backpack recipe with dyes
    Crafting - support meta/damage values
    Add tiers to upgrades (so you need at least tier x of backpack to apply upgrade y)
    Add nests to world-gen

Mod Support:
    NEI with recipes[DONE]
    Inventory Tweaks

Future Refactoring:
    Change upgrades to be one item differentiated by damage value
