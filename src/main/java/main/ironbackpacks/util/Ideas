To Do:

    NOW:

        --Try building and testing in DW20-- Not yet, redo proxies and crashes and whatnot


    SOON:

        REFACTOR:
            Allow shift right click equipped?
                If can figure it out, can shift right click to open nested guis too
                If not, just make it right click only and save for next update

        BUGS:
            Equipped backpack gone on death (check with and without eternity upgrade)
            Depth not working with restocking?
                restocking when going from 63 -> stack gives an extra stack?
            Check mod specific filter not working (AE2 specifically)

        ADDITIONS/TWEAKS:
            make crafting upgrade work when manually putting items in
            Open right click direct from 'e' inventory?
            Check lag with crafting upgrade?
            Crafting upgrade in 2x2
            Have depth upgrade apply to quick deposit

        Make backpacks not enchantable

        Add items "gem" and "dust" to miner filter -add to tooltip and changelog
            change so it picks up cobble and smooth stone too and remove from alt gui?

        Test open blocks compat only running on only client side as potential fix?
            If can't figure it out, just disable feature for next release.

        Check import Keyboard as cause of server crash

        Fix buttons moving curr pack into itself

        Fix backpack on player rendering with hang glider, odd bug

        New removal system of upgrades?
            Craft backpack with nothing else, slot if crafting grid determines which upgrade to remove
                i.e. 1st slot means 1st upgrade removed, 2nd slot -> 2nd upgrade removed,..., 9th slot -> 9th upgrade removed
                    if more than 9 upgrades you have to keep on doing it, but that is an acceptable cost
            if can't do this, do eraser item

        ADDED: Ability to shift right click nested backpacks to open their alternate gui

        add ender upgrade?
            allows you to use the filter/restocking to go into an ender pouch in the inventory

        Change sorting to a configurable style (i.e. id, name, etc.) w/ right click sort button to change style in game

        Check out NEI not ordering items properly (i.e. upgrades mixed in in-between backpacks)

        Add in more inter-mod compatibility
            right click in my backpack to open TE satchels, golden bag of holding, etc.
            add IBlockProvider for use with botania's rods

        Add ability to shift right click backpacks to open alt-guis

        Make textures of upgrades more 3D looking

        Add documentation book - see TiCon books source
            * or add ExtraUtils style docs with "u" in NEI * <-- This one, check power converters Github for implementation

        Add achievements

        Edit MCF post with new pictures/graphics/etc - overhaul

    LATER:

        //Craft any backpack surrounded by planks to turn it into a placeable custom chest/tileEntity and then shapeless craft the chest to get the backpack back (IChestable)
        Place down TileEntityBackpack directly - if the controls can work that way, if not do the chest method

        Power/Fluid/Gas Upgrades (dynamic sizing on left side)


    EVENTUAL FEATURES:
        Gui Config

        custom handling with other mods armors special rendering to render my pack in special spots?

        Barrel Backpacks (implement IChestable)

        Craft a diamond/barrel/ender (IDyeable) backpack with dyes to color it

Changelog:
ADDED: The ability to equip and open a backpack with keybindings.
ADDED: Equipped backpacks render on the player with a custom model.
ADDED: Depth Upgrade
ADDED: Mining Filter Upgrade
ADDED: Ability to right click ender storage backpacks inside iron backpacks to open them
FIXED: Corner case with not being able to move a different backpack in your hotbar while another is open.
CHANGED: The sorting button now sorts by ID, with iron backpacks always being in the front slots (i.e. top left slots)
CHANGED: All the textures (backpacks and items) to slightly improved versions.
CHANGED: Config option regarding the alternate backpack textures so it is clear the HD one is default.
CHANGED: Default gold and diamond backpack recipes are slightly cheaper.
CHANGED: Changed the Fuzzy filter's default recipe to something less confusing.
CHANGED: Altered the default upgrade points on the backpack tiers to be slightly higher.

MCF Posting:
Add that it has full Thaumcraft aspect support
Open blocks won't render backpack with glider on
Mod armors that have larger custom models might overlap with my backpack model, just visually annoying


Balance/Play With:


Bugs:
    IMPORTANT:


    Less important:
        Scrolling too fast in the advanced filter dupes items (but they are ghost items so no big deal)
        Fix direct deposit into AE terminals
