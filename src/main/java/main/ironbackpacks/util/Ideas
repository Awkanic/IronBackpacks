To Do:
    Clicking on inventory (chest) with backpack empties backpack into inventory

    Figure out filter expansion (18 slots) upgrade
        Just add another filter upgrade (extended) and this expands by 9 slots and another row (so I need to do more textures)
        Add in filter (ore Dictionary) version too [and maybe other versions if I think of them]
            That means furnace upgrade can be an option for taking up row #4 as well

    Add button upgrade expansion to alt gui - [c] on same line as upgrade name aligned right which clears the items in that row
        Change y-spacing, it is off

MCF Posting:
    Upload default recipe screenshots

Balance/Play With:
    Fancier config file

Figure out:
    How to render a backpack on your back
        (look at better storage's code)
        #vazkii on espernet

    Recipe removal? (craft w/ upgrade present and it will remove it) - will mess up in NBT loading as currently coded

Tiers:
    Leather[DONE]
    Iron[DONE]
    Gold[DONE]
    Diamond[DONE]

Types:
    Item
    Barrel
    Fluid - acts like bucket when right click

Upgrades:
    Button upgrade[DONE] -If ghostSlot doesn't work, add buttons for shift-clicking-like feature for alt gui upgrades
    Nesting upgrade[DONE] - lower tier goes in higher tier
    Renaming upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE?] - rename the backpack, included by default -change background color of text box to light brown (see anvil) + redo button to say "rename"
    Hopper upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE] - keeps an item stocked - needs to have at least 1 of target item in player's inventory to resupply
    Condenser upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE] - compresses items
    Filter upgrade{ALT GUI}[DONE] - automatically picks up specified items - Button to alter fuzzy behavior?
    Inventory upgrade? - extends inventory (probably only will be used in final tier)
    Camelpack upgrade - eat from it
    Umbrella upgrade - slow fall
    KeepOnDeath upgrade[DONE] - really expensive but keep backpack on death
    UpgradeAddon upgrade - adds another upgrade slot - would have to change how I deal with upgrades; store Upgrades all as NBT data (length of array is upgradeCount)
    Furnace Upgrade{ALT GUI} - smelt things in your backpack using smelt-able materials from the backpack? //Will have to change something with alt-gui as noted below
    Ender Upgrade - links this backpack to your ender chest
    Mod Specific Filter upgrade[DONE] - makes it so that the filter upgrade will pick up any item from mod x, where x is the mod that an item in the filter slot is from.

    If add another alt.Gui upgrade have to check recipe before applying (b/c can only have 3 alt. gui upgrades (plus naming) due to gui sizing limitation unless I expand the gui horizontally).

Textures:
    Change "name" button to "rename" - background as button w/ overlayed localized name?

    Redo:

    Do:

Misc features:
    Add in colorable backpack recipe with dyes
    Crafting - support meta/damage values
    Add tiers to upgrades (so you need at least tier x of backpack to apply upgrade y)
    Add nests to world-gen

Mod Support:
    NEI with recipes[DONE]
    Inventory Tweaks[DONE]

Future Refactoring:

    Make the scope of fields/methods less public

    Full localization
        Includes tooltips
        Buttons (if applicable)
