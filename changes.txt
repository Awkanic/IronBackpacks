Version 1.7.10 - 26
------------------------------------------------------
Additions
- Small Crafting Upgrade: Crafts in a 2x2 grid (ex: sand -> sandstone)
- Small Crafting Upgrade: Crafts in a 1x1 grid (so a single item, ex: wood -> planks)

Changes
- Description of of mining filter to show that it picks up gems and dusts as well.
- Changed versioning to r(MC_Version)-(Mod_Version) (ex: r1.7.10-26) because I am doing a lot of builds
- gradle.build is fancier now (by default it will clean, update version number, build, upload to curse, and make a new changelog segment for the next version)

Bug Fixes
- Precautionary fix for sided inventories and inserting items via the quick deposit upgrade (may fix the unduplicated StorageDrawers bug)
