Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. Great. Here's what you have to do:
* Read through the steps on [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/) (You may skip this if you're already familiar with reporting issues, but it's good for newcomers);
* Note the following points:
  * Issues regarding MCPC+/Cauldron that are not reproducible with forge only are **not accepted**;
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the mod are **not accepted**;
  * If you ahve an issue with a modpack, amke sure it is this mod that is causing the error befor eposting it, and that you have the updated versions of all the relevant mods.;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed without asking.
  * Do not tag your issues' names. "Something Broke" is prefered to "[Bug] Something Broke"  because there's a proper label system in place.

[Report the Issue](https://github.com/gr8pefish/IronBackpacks/issues)!

If you want to make a Pull Request keep these in mind:
* Do NOT use the github editor. Test your damn PRs before you submit them.
* Make sure your PR's syntax matches the syntax of the rest of the code.
* If your pull request edits very small chunks of code and isn't flawless I'll close it as it'll probably take less time to fix it myself rather than pull yours and change the code.
* Unless you have a very good reason for it, keep your PRs all in one commit. You can do it with [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).
